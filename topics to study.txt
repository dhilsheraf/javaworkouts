1-  Callbacks vs promises
2-  Event deligation (evnt blng,evnt captring,)
3-  Factory Functions (returns object)
4-  Template Literals (backtick)
5-  Object Literals 
6-  String Coercion
7-  Var , let , const
8-  Functional Scope vs Block Scope 
9-  event loop & code execution
10- memoization
11- continue
13- event driven architecture 
14- Object.prototype (inherit properties and methods from one object to another)
16- bind
17- Purpose of closures
18- purpose/benefits of higher order function (it takes one or more fnctn as argmnt and rtrns new fnctn)
19- process.nexttick
20- piping
21- object manipulation (working with objects, accessing, updating, creating, removing, adding)
22- bitwise operator( & , | , ^ xor , ~ not, << left shift)
23- implicit and explicit coercion (implicit : autmatic convertion, explicit : one data type to another by inbuild keywords)
24- benefits of iife (immediate exctn, it will not harm global namespace pollution)
25- variable shadowing (when a variable declared within a certain scope has the same name as a variable in an outer scope)
26- default parameter
27- weak set
28- weak map
29- object.seal vs object.freeze (write only, read only)
30- event bubbling (child to parent)
31- event captring (parent to child)
32- call by value (modifying value inside fnctn. it will not effect the out side variable) 
33- call by reference (eg: adding value to a array inside fnctn. so the actual array modified)
34- constructor (instnc of objct)
35- arrow fnctn vs normal fnctn
36- ways to make object
37- exec() (method used in (regex) to execute a search for a match in a specified string.It returns an array of information or null if no match is found)
38- hoisting 
39- closure
40- this keyword
41- promise states and methods
42- event propagation
43- map/filter/reduce
44- array methods (map,fltr,rdc,freach)
45- fnct composition (two or more functions are combined to create a new function)
46- throttling
47- deep freeze (to freeze all nested ojects)
48- currying needs
49- nullish operator
50- escape sequence(\n, \t)
51- map vs hashmap
52- ternary operator
53- higher order fnctn
54- first order fnctn (do not take a fnctn as a armnt or return a fnctn)
55- first class fnctn (a fnctn which is assigned to a variable or send as a argument to another function or returned by a fnctn)
56- spread operator (let arr = [...arr1,...arr2])
57- rest operator vs rest parameter (for destructuring [a,b,...c] = x,  fnctn ab(...x))
58- exception handling (to avoid runtime error, try catch finally)
59- control sequence (if else, else if , switch,for loop, while loop, do while loop)
60- method chaining (calling multiple methods on a same object eg: obj.add(1).add(2).add(3))
61- object destructuring
Find Second Highest and second least element from an array
8-  Find the sum of prime numbers in a array 
9-  reverse an array without using a new array & .reverse() method
10- find key with highest value in an object
11- generator function implementaions
concat ooperation

practice this all

1) Array: map, filter, reduce, find, sort, forEach 

Q1) 
find sum of age less than 30 
[
  { age: 28, name: "John Doe" },
  { age: 34, name: "Jane Smith" },
  { age: 29, name: "Alice Johnson" },
  { age: 42, name: "Bob Brown" }
]

Q2) 
find sum of this array
const ab = [{af:34},{af:34},{af:34},{af:34}]

Q3) 
Write a Javascript program to display the status (I.e. display book name, author name & reading status) of books. You are given an object library in the code's template. It contains a list of books with the above mentioned properties.Your task is to display the following:

If the book is unread:
You still need to read '<book_name>' by <author_name>.
If the book is read:
Already read '<book_name>' by <author_name>.


Q4) 
Question: Multiply each element in array with index [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to its double?"
Expected Output: [0, 2, 6, 12, 20]
Hint: Map

Q5)
Question: "How can you filter out only the odd numbers from the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]?"
Expected Output: [1, 3, 5]
Find the highest number in an array:
Hint: filter

Q6)
Question: "How can you find the maximum value in the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]?"
Expected Output: 5
Find the smallest number in an array:
Hint: reduce

Q7)
Question: "How can you find the minimum value in the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]?"
Expected Output: 1
Sum of all numbers in an array:
Hint: reduce

Q8)
Question: "How can you calculate the sum of all the elements in the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]?"
Expected Output: 15
Hint: reduce


Examples of Methods 

2) Functions: call, apply, bind

3) Objects: add, remove, modify an property, Object.keys, Object.values, Object.entries, Object.seal, Object.freeze, Object.assign(), Object.hasOwnProperty()

4) String (less likely) : length, toUpperCase(), toLowerCase(), trim(), substring(), indexOf(), replace(), split(), charAt(), includes()

Examples of Concepts 

Promises - promise.all, promise.allsettled, promise.race, promise.any, async await

shallow copy, deep copy, 

currying, callback, funtion expression, arrow function,  

spread, rest

try catch finally, prototpye

Find Second Highest and second least element from an array

8-  Find the sum of prime numbers in a array 
9-  reverse an array without using a new array & .reverse() method
10- find key with highest value in an object
11- generator function implementaions
